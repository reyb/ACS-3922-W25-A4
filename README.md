# ACS-3922 W25 Assignment 4

------

### Getting Started

- Step 1: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repo link>` (follow the instructions in A0 and/or the [Git Fundamentals document on Nexus](https://nexus.uwinnipeg.ca/d2l/le/content/67597/viewContent/1909272/View) if unsure about this process). Note this repository has some files aleady included. These are this README and a .gitignore. You do not need to edit the .gitignore file but should make sure to leave it within the repository. 
- Step 2: Now we need to start a Unity project within the repository.
  - **If you have a project already (i.e., you have already started the assignment before cloning)**: Copy and paste the project folders (Assets, Packages, Scripts, Project Settings etc.) into your cloned repository. DO NOT copy the folder containing the project folders. That is, if your Unity project is in an `A2` folder, you should copy all contents of the `A2` folder and not the `A2` folder itself.)
  - **If you need to create a new project**: In Unity - Create a new project and change the location of the project to be in the cloned git folder.

- Step 3: Commit and Push the changes. 

- Step 4: Continue working on the assignment on Unity as you would normally do and commit + push the code throughout (follow the instructions in A0 and/or the [Git Fundamentals document on Nexus](https://nexus.uwinnipeg.ca/d2l/le/content/67597/viewContent/1909272/View) if unsure about this process). 

**NOTE**: Some folders and files which are in a Unity project might not be pushed to the remote repository and hence you will not be able to see them on github even after pushing your changes. There is no need to worry, this is *intentional* and is done to make sure that the extra Unity files which can and will be re-generated later by the TAs are not uploaded/pushed on github, since that consumes a lot of storage on the repository. This is exclusion of files on purpose is done by the `.gitignore` file which specifies all the files that git can ignore to be tracked and hence they will not be pushed.
